    <h1>Friederichs, Kylee</h1>
    <p>I am a Computer Science major, but I also have a Space minor because most of the classes for the minor align with the classes 
        I already have to take (plus, I also think learning about space is really cool). I also have a TAM minor because I wanted to be
        able to later take a game design class because back in high school, I had originally decided that I wanted to major in game design!
        In my free time, I am also an artist with a focus of digital art as a medium. 
    </p>
    <p>I am studying Computer Science for a number of reasons. Both of my parents were both once in the field of computers 
        (but in a couple of different parts)--this means I grew up with a lot of influence with technology, going to various computer conventions
        like Defcon. I also decided to study Computer Science because I figured it would be more flexible than only focusing on game design.
